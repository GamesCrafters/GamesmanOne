 * @author Max Delgadillo: designed and implemented the original version

 * @author Robert Shi (robertyishi@berkeley.edu): Extracted the reverse graph
 * implementation as a separate module from the tier solver, replaced
 * linked-lists with dynamic arrays for optimization, and implemented
 * thread-safety for the new OpenMP multithreaded tier solver.
 * @author GamesCrafters Research Group, UC Berkeley
 *         Supervised by Dan Garcia <ddgarcia@cs.berkeley.edu>
