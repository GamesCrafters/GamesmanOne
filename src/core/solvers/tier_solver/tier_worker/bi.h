 * @brief Solves \p tier using the backward induction algorithm given \p api.
 *
 * @param api Game-specific tier solver API functions.
 * @param db_chunk_size Number of positions in each database compression block.
 * The algorithm then uses this number as the chunk size for OpenMP dynamic
 * scheduling to prevent repeated decompression of the same block.
 * @param tier Tier to solve.
 * @param options Pointer to a \c TierWorkerSolveOptions object which contains

 * @param solved (Output parameter) If non-NULL, its value will be set to
 * \c true if \p tier is actually solved, or \p false if \p tier is loaded from
 * an existing database.
 * @return kNoError on success, or
