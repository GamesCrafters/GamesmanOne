/**
 * @file tier_manager.h
 * @author Max Delgadillo: designed and implemented the original version
 * of tier solver (solveretrograde.c in GamesmanClassic.)
 * @author Robert Shi (robertyishi@berkeley.edu): Separated functions that
 * handle tier graph traversal and management into its own module, and
 * redesigned retrograde tier analysis process to enable concurrent solving
 * of multiple tiers.
 * @author GamesCrafters Research Group, UC Berkeley
 *         Supervised by Dan Garcia <ddgarcia@cs.berkeley.edu>
 * @brief Manager module of the Loopy Tier Solver.
 *
 * @details The tier manager module is responsible for scanning, validating, and
 * creating the tier graph in memory, keeping track of solved and solvable
 * tiers, and dispatching jobs to the tier worker module.
 * @version 1.5.0
 * @date 2025-03-30
