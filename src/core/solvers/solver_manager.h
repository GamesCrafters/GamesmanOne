 * @brief Solver manager module which handles solver loading, solving, and
 * database status checking.
 *
 * @details One of the key assumptions made by GAMESMAN is that "no more than
 * one game can be loaded at the same time," because a user can always run
 * multiple instances of GAMESMAN if they wish to solve/play multiple games
 * simultaneously. As a result, no more than one solver or database can be
 * loaded at the same time. This module handles the loading and deallocation
 * of THE ONE solver used by the current GAMESMAN instance.
 * @version 2.0.0
