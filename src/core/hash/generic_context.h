/**
 * @brief Describes the restrictions on pieces and board size of an hash
 * environment in which Generic Hashing is performed.
 *
 * @par Definitions:
 * The following definitions are used throughout the implementation
 * GenericHashContext.
 *
 * @par
 * Board pieces: pieces that appear on the board. Each slot on the game board is
 * considered unique, thus different orderings of the board pieces correspond to
 * different positions.
 *
 * @par
 * Unordered pieces: collection of pieces whose order does not matter. An
 * example would be pieces that are removed from the board and waiting to be put
 * back on in Dōbutsu shōgi.
 *
 * @par
 * Pieces array: a fixed-length char array representing each type of piece.
 * Predefined by the user of the Generic Hash system.
 *
 * @par
 * Piece configuration: an array of integers representing the number of each
 * type of piece on board. The length of the array is equal to the length of the
 * piece array (n) plus the number of types of pieces in the unordered section
 * (m-n). For 0 <= i < n, \c piece_config[i] represents the number of pieces[i].
 * For n <= i <= m, \c piece_config[i] corresponds to the number of the
 * (i-n)-th unordered piece.
 *
 * @par
 * Valid piece configuration: a piece configuration is valid for a hash context
 * if and only if
 * 1. the total number of board pieces is equal to \c board_size, and
 * 2. \c context.IsValidConfig(configuration) returns \c true. Note that the
 * user may choose not to enforce the first rule in their own \c IsValidConfig
 * function and assume that Generic Hash system performs the check for them.
 * Also note that the piece configurations are generated based on the
 * user-provided lower and upper bounds of each type of piece. Hence there is no
 * need to check the boundaries.
 *
 * @par
 * Piece configuration index: an unique integer assigned to a piece
 * configuration. This integer is calculated based on the minimum and maximum
 * number of each type of piece as specified by the user and is very similar
 * to a "hash" value. To avoid confusion with game position hashing, we choose
 * the name "index" instead.

/**
 * @brief Initializes the given Generic Hash \p context. Zeros out the contents
 * in \p context and returns \c false on failure.
 *
 * @note Initializing an already initialized \p context results in undefined
 * behavior and may cause memory leak.
 *
 * @param context Context to initialize, which is assumed to be uninitialized.
 * @param board_size Size of the game board. E.g. board_size == 9 in
 * Tic-Tac-Toe.
 * @param player May take values 0, 1, or 2. If set to 0, a two-player hash
 * context will be initialized, and \c GenericHashContextGetTurn will return the
 * turn based on the given hash value. If set to either 1 or 2, a single-player
 * hash context will be initialized, and \c GenericHashContextGetTurn will
 * always return that player's index regardless of the given hash value. E.g.
 * set this to 0 for the game of Chess, and set this to 1 for all tiers that
 * correspond to player X's turn in Tic-Tac-Toe.
 * @param pieces_init_array An integer array of the following format:
 * [p_1, L_1, U_1, p_2, L_2, U_2, ..., p_n, L_n, U_n,
 * (-2, L_{n+1}, U_{n+1}, L_{n+2}, U_{n+2}, ..., L_m, U_m,) -1] where
 * - The \c p_i 's are the characters associated with the pieces (including
 * blanks.) Min: 0; Max: 127.
 * - The \c L_i 's for i in range(1, n+1) are the minimum allowable number of
 * occurrences of each piece type on the board. Min: 0; Max: \c U_i.
 * - The \c U_i 's for i in range(1, n+1) are the maximum allowable number of
 * occurrences of each piece type on the board. Min: \c L_i; Max: board_size.
 * - (Optional, v1.2.0+) The value -2 is used to separate the board pieces from
 * the unordered pieces, if exist.
 * - (Optional, v1.2.0+) The \c L_j 's for j in range(n+1, m) are the minimum
 * allowable number of occurrences of each piece type that may appear in the
 * unordered section of the game. Min: 0; Max: \c U_j.
 * - (Optional, v1.2.0+) The \c U_j 's for j in range(n+1, m) are the maximum
 * allowable number of occurrences of each piece type that may appear in the
 * unordered section of the game. Min: \c L_j; Max: 127.
 * - The value \c -1 is used to mark the end of the array.
 * \example 1: set this to {'-', 0, 9, 'O', 0, 4, 'X', 0, 5, -1} for the game of
 * Tic-Tac-Toe. Explanation: there can be at least 0 or at most 9 blank slots,
 * at least 0 or at most 4 O's on the board, and at least 0 or at most 5 X's on
 * the board, assuming X always goes first.
 * \example 2: one may set this to {'L', 0, 1, 'l', 0, 1, 'G', 0, 2, 'g', 0, 2,
 * 'E', 0, 2, 'e', 0, 2, 'H', 0, 2, 'h', 0, 2, 'C', 0, 2, 'c', 0, 2, '-', 4, 11,
 * -2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, -1} for the game of Dōbutsu shōgi. The triplets before
 * the -2 denote the pieces that may appear on the board, whereas each pair
 * between the -2 and the -1 denotes a type of piece that the forest player may
 * have captured and not yet placed back into the board. Since the total number
 * of each type of piece is fixed, there is no need to store the number of
 * pieces held by the sky player since we can figure it out by looking at the
 * board.
 * @param IsValidConfig Pointer to a user-defined configuration validation
 * function which returns true if the given piece configuration is valid based
 * on game rules. The system will determine if configuration is valid using this
 * function while performing an additional check on the total number of pieces,
 * which should add up to board_size. If NULL is passed to this value, a piece
 * configuration will be considered valid as long as the numbers of each type of
 * piece add up to board_size. \note A piece configuration is an integer array
 * of size \c m (number of board pieces plus number of unordered pieces.) Each
 * value in this array denotes the number of that type of piece currently
 * appearing in the game. The first \c n (number of board pieces) values in a
 * piece configuration array denotes the number of board pieces of each type.
 * These values have a one-to-one correspondance with the first \c n pieces in
 * the \p pieces_init_array in the same order. The rest of the \c (m-n) pieces
 * correspond to the unordered pieces initialized by the last \c (m-n) pairs of
 * values in the \p pieces_init_array. As in example 2, one valid piece
 * configuration would be the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0],
 * where the last three zeros correspond to the unordered pieces.
 * @return \c true on success,
 * @return \c false otherwise.
