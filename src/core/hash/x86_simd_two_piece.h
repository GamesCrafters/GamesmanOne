 * @brief Hash system for tier games with boards of size 32 or less and using no
 * more than two types of pieces. The following restrictions apply to the game:
 *
 * 1. The tier definition of the game must be based on the number of remaining
 * pieces each player. The hash functions provided in this library returns the
 * hash value of positions within the corresponding tier with the above
 * definition. For example, when using this library to hash positions in
 * Tic-Tac-Toe, the tiers must be defined as [0X 0O], [1X 0O], [1X 1O], [2X 1O],
 * [2X 2O], ..., [5X 4O]. Subdivision or merging of tiers are currently
 * unsupported.
 *
 * 2. There must exist a way to map the board onto a 8x8 grid. Examples of valid
 * game boards include all rectangular/square game boards with both dimensions
 * smaller than 8 and the board for Nine Men's Morris, which can be mapped onto
 * a 7x7 grid.
 *
 * @note This library only provides minimal safety checks on input values for
 * performance.
 * @note This library requires Intel SSE2, SSE4.1 and BMI2 instruction sets.
 * @details Usage guide: this hash system provides functions to convert board
 * representations to position hash values within each tier (hashing) and to
 * convert hash values back to boards (unhashing). The tiers are defined using
 * the numbers of the two types of pieces on the board. The boards are
 * represented as __m128i variables containing two bit boards each of length 64
 * describing the locations of the pieces. The lower 64 bits represent the
 * locations of the first type of piece (X) and the upper 64 bits represent the
 * locations of the second type of piece (O).
 *
 * When initialized with a rectangular board layout, the patterns are padded
 * with zeros at the end of each row and column so that the board is mapped to
 * the bottom right corner of a 8x8 bit grid. The number of rows and columns of
 * the original board is referred to as the numbers of "effective rows" and
 * "effective columns."
 *
 * When initialized with a custom board mask, the effective board slots are
 * those that correspond to the set bits (1 bits) in the mask.
 *
 * The above definitions are better illustrated using the 2 examples below.
 * In both examples, we use 'X' to represent the first type of piece, 'O' to
 * represent the second, and '-' to represent blank slots. We 0-index the board
 * slots from the bottom right to the top left in row-major order as follows
 * (showing 3x3 for brevity but generalizes to all valid board dimensions):
 *
 *     8 7 6
 *     5 4 3
 *     2 1 0
 *
 * @example 1. Rectangular/Square board initialized using the
 * X86SimdTwoPieceHashInit function.
 *
 * The following example position in a Tic-Tac-Toe game represented using the
 * 3x3 board
 *
 *     X O -
 *     - X X
 *     O - O
 *
 * is equivalent to the result of overlapping the following two boards
 *
 *     X - -    - O -
 *     - X X    - - -
 *     - - -    O - O
 *
 * The boards are first mapped to the following 8x8 grids
 *
 *     - - - - - - - -    - - - - - - - -
 *     - - - - - - - -    - - - - - - - -
 *     - - - - - - - -    - - - - - - - -
 *     - - - - - - - -    - - - - - - - -
 *     - - - - - - - -    - - - - - - - -
 *     - - - - - X - -    - - - - - - O -
 *     - - - - - - X X    - - - - - - - -
 *     - - - - - - - -    - - - - - O - O
 *
 * and then represented as
 *
 *     // Using C++ notation for binary numbers, not valid syntax in C.
 *     uint64_t raw[2] = {
 *         0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'00000100'00000011'00000000,
 *         0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'00000010'00000000'00000101,
 *     };
 *     __m128i board = _mm_loadu_si128(raw);
 *
 * The boards are mapped to 64-bit grids to allow efficient flipping, mirroring,
 * and rotating, for which the algorithms can be found on Chess Programming Wiki
 * https://www.chessprogramming.org/Flipping_Mirroring_and_Rotating.
 * Methods to perform these operations are provided in this library for
 * efficient symmetry removal.
 *
 * @example 2. Irregular board initialized using the
 * X86SimdTwoPieceHashInitIrregular function.
 *
 * The game of Nine Men's Morris uses the following irregular board:
 *
 *    ( )---------( ) --------( )
 *     |           |           |
 *     |  ( )-----( )-----( )  |
 *     |   |       |       |   |
 *     |   |  ( )-( )-( )  |   |
 *     |   |   |       |   |   |
 *    ( )-( )-( )     ( )-( )-( )
 *     |   |   |       |   |   |
 *     |   |  ( )-( )-( )  |   |
 *     |   |       |       |   |
 *     |  ( ) ----( )---- ( )  |
 *     |           |           |
 *    ( )---------( ) --------( )
 *
 * Notice if we allow gaps between neighboring intersections, the board
 * intersections can be mapped onto a 7x7 grid:
 *
 *     1 0 0 1 0 0 1
 *     0 1 0 1 0 1 0
 *     0 0 1 1 1 0 0
 *     1 0 1 0 1 0 1
 *     0 0 1 1 1 0 0
 *     0 1 0 1 0 1 0
 *     1 0 0 1 0 0 1
 *
 * The "board mask" for this game is therefore the result of mapping this 7x7
 * grid onto the bottom right corner of an 8x8 grid:
 *
 *     // Using C++ notation for binary numbers, not valid syntax in C.
 *     uint64_t board_mask =
 *         0b00000000'01001001'00101010'00011100'01010101'00011100'00101010'01001001
 *
 * The following example position in a Nine Men's Morris game represented using
 * the irregular board
 *
 *    ( )---------( ) --------( )
 *     |           |           |
 *     |  ( )----- X -----( )  |
 *     |   |       |       |   |
 *     |   |   X -( )-( )  |   |
 *     |   |   |       |   |   |
 *    ( )- O -( )     ( )-( )-( )
