 * @author Robert Shi (robertyishi@berkeley.edu): reimplemented with 64-bit

 * efficient board mirroring and rotation.

 * @brief Hash system for tier games with rectangular boards of size 32 or less
 * and using no more than two types of pieces.
 * @note The system assumes that the game is tiered based on the number of
 * remaining pieces of each type.
 * @note This module provides minimal safety check for inputs for performance.
 * The user should carefully read the the instructions before using this
 * library.
 * @note This module requires Intel SSE2 and BMI2 instruction sets.
 * @details Usage guide: this hash system provides functions to convert board
 * representations to position hash values within each tier (hashing) and to
 * convert hash values back to boards (unhashing). The tiers are defined using
 * the numbers of the two types of pieces on the board. The boards are
 * represented as __m128i variables containing two bit boards each of length 64
 * describing the locations of the pieces. The lower 64 bits show the locations
 * of the first type of piece (X) and the upper 64 bits show the second type of
 * piece (O). Furthermore, the patterns are padded with zeros at the end of each
 * row and column so that the board is mapped to the bottom right corner of a
 * 8x8 bit grid. The number of rows and columns of the original board is
 * referred to as the numbers of "effective rows" and "effective columns."
 *
 * The above definitions are better illustrated using the example below, in
 * which we use 'X' to represent the first type of piece, 'O' to represent the
 * second, and '-' to represent blank slots. We 0-index the board slots from
 * bottom right to top left in row-major order as follows (showing 3x3 for
 * brevity but generalizes to all possible board dimensions):
 *
 *     8 7 6
 *     5 4 3
 *     2 1 0
 *
 * @example A 3x3 board
 *
 *     X O -
 *     - X X
 *     O - O
 *
 * which is equivalent to the result of overlapping the following two boards
 *
 *     X - -    - O -
 *     - X X    - - -
 *     - - -    O - O
 *
 * is first mapped to the following 8x8 grids
 *
 *     - - - - - - - -    - - - - - - - -
 *     - - - - - - - -    - - - - - - - -
 *     - - - - - - - -    - - - - - - - -
 *     - - - - - - - -    - - - - - - - -
 *     - - - - - - - -    - - - - - - - -
 *     - - - - - X - -    - - - - - - O -
 *     - - - - - - X X    - - - - - - - -
 *     - - - - - - - -    - - - - - O - O
 *
 * and then represented as
 *
 *     // Using C++ notation for binary numbers, not valid syntax in C.
 *     uint64_t raw[2] = {
 *         0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'00000100'00000011'00000000,
 *         0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'00000010'00000000'00000101,
 *     };
 *     __m128i board = _mm_loadu_si128(raw);
 *
 * The boards are mapped to 64-bit grids to allow efficient flipping, mirroring,
 * and rotating, for which the algorithms can be found on Chess Programming Wiki
 * https://www.chessprogramming.org/Flipping_Mirroring_and_Rotating.
 * Methods to perform these operations are provided in this library for
 * efficient symmetry removal.
