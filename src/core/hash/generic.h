 * @brief (Re)initializes the Generic Hash system, clearing all previously

/**
 * @brief Adds a new Generic Hash Context to the system.
 *
 * @param player May take values 0, 1, or 2. If set to 0, a two-player hash
 * context will be initialized and a turn bit will be added to the final hash
 * value to distinguish between 1st player's turn vs. 2nd player's turn; If set
 * to 1: initialize in 1st player only mode; If set to 2: initialize in 2nd
 * player only mode. E.g., set this to 0 for the game of Chess, and set this to
 * 1 for all tiers that correspond to player X's turn in Tic-Tac-Toe.
 * @param board_size Size of the board. E.g., this value should be set to 9 for
 * the game to Tic-Tac-Toe.
 * @param pieces_init_array An integer array of the following format:
 * [p_1, L_1, U_1, p_2, L_2, U_2, ..., p_n, L_n, U_n,
 * (-2, L_{n+1}, U_{n+1}, L_{n+2}, U_{n+2}, ..., L_m, U_m,) -1] where
 * - The \c p_i 's are the characters associated with the pieces (including
 * blanks.) Min: 0; Max: 127.
 * - The \c L_i 's for i in range(1, n+1) are the minimum allowable number of
 * occurrences of each piece type on the board. Min: 0; Max: \c U_i.
 * - The \c U_i 's for i in range(1, n+1) are the maximum allowable number of
 * occurrences of each piece type on the board. Min: \c L_i; Max: board_size.
 * - (Optional, v1.1.0+) The value -2 is used to separate the board pieces from
 * the unordered pieces, if exist.
 * - (Optional, v1.1.0+) The \c L_j 's for j in range(n+1, m) are the minimum
 * allowable number of occurrences of each piece type that may appear in the
 * unordered section of the game. Min: 0; Max: \c U_j.
 * - (Optional, v1.1.0+) The \c U_j 's for j in range(n+1, m) are the maximum
 * allowable number of occurrences of each piece type that may appear in the
 * unordered section of the game. Min: \c L_j; Max: 127.
 * - The value \c -1 is used to mark the end of the array.
 * \example 1: set this to {'-', 0, 9, 'O', 0, 4, 'X', 0, 5, -1} for the game of
 * Tic-Tac-Toe. Explanation: there can be at least 0 or at most 9 blank slots,
 * at least 0 or at most 4 O's on the board, and at least 0 or at most 5 X's on
 * the board, assuming X always goes first.
 * \example 2: one may set this to {'L', 0, 1, 'l', 0, 1, 'G', 0, 2, 'g', 0, 2,
 * 'E', 0, 2, 'e', 0, 2, 'H', 0, 2, 'h', 0, 2, 'C', 0, 2, 'c', 0, 2, '-', 4, 11,
 * -2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, -1} for the game of Dōbutsu shōgi. The triplets before
 * the -2 denote the pieces that may appear on the board, whereas each pair
 * between the -2 and the -1 denotes a type of piece that the forest player may
 * have captured and not yet placed back into the board. Since the total number
 * of each type of piece is fixed, there is no need to store the number of
 * pieces held by the sky player since we can figure it out by looking at the
 * board.
 * @param IsValidConfig Pointer to a user-defined configuration validation
 * function which returns true if the given piece configuration is valid based
 * on game rules. The system will determine if configuration is valid using this
 * function while performing an additional check on the total number of pieces,
 * which should add up to board_size. If NULL is passed to this value, a piece
 * configuration will be considered valid as long as the numbers of each type of
 * piece add up to board_size. \note A piece configuration is an integer array
 * of size \c m (number of board pieces plus number of unordered pieces.) Each
 * value in this array denotes the number of that type of piece currently
 * appearing in the game. The first \c n (number of board pieces) values in a
 * piece configuration array denotes the number of board pieces of each type.
 * These values have a one-to-one correspondance with the first \c n pieces in
 * the \p pieces_init_array in the same order. The rest of the \c (m-n) pieces
 * correspond to the unordered pieces initialized by the last \c (m-n) pairs of
 * values in the \p pieces_init_array. As in example 2, one valid piece
 * configuration would be the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0],
 * where the last three zeros correspond to the unordered pieces.
 * @param label An unique integer label for the new Generic Hash Context. The
 * recommended way to manage multiple contexts in a tier game is to use the
 * \c Tier hash values as the labels on the corresponding contexts.
 * @return \c true on success,
 * @return \c false if \p player is not in the range [0, 2], a context was
 * already created under \p label, \p pieces_init_array is malformed, or any
 * error such as malloc failure occurred.
