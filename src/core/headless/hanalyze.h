 * @brief Analyzes the variant VARIANT_ID of game GAME_NAME.

 * @param game_name Name of the game internal to GAMESMAN.
 * @param variant_id Variant index of the game. The default variant will be
 * analyzed instead set to a negative value.
 * @param data_path Path to the `data` directory. The default data path will be
 * used if set to NULL.
 * @param force If true, the system will force re-analyze the given game
 * regardless of the current analysis status.
 * @param verbose May take values 0, 1, or 2. If set to 0, no output will be
 * produced to stdout. Set to 1 for default output level. Set to 2 for more
 * detailed output.
 * @param memlimit Approximate heap memory limit in bytes.
 * @return 0 on success, non-zero error code otherwise.
