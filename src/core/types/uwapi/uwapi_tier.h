 * implemented by all tier games to facilitate the generation of JSON responses
 * for GamesCraftersUWAPI (Universal Web API). UWAPI is an internal
 * request-routing server framework that allows the backend solving and serving
 * systems such as GamesmanOne and GamesmanClassic to provide game rules and
 * database querying service for the GamesmanUni online game generator.
