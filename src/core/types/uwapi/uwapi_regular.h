 * @details A UwapiRegular object defines a set of helper functions that must be
 * implemented by all regular (non-tier) games to facilitate the generation of
 * JSON responses for GamesCraftersUWAPI (Universal Web API). UWAPI is an
 * internal request-routing server framework that allows the backend solving and
 * serving systems such as GamesmanOne and GamesmanClassic to provide game rules
 * and database querying service for the GamesmanUni online game generator.
