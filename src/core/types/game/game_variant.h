/**
 * @brief Game variant as an array of selected variant options.
 *
 * @details A game variant is determined by a set of variant options. Each
 * variant option decides some aspect of the game rule. The game developer is
 * responsible for providing the possible choices for each one of the variant
 * options as strings (see GameVariantOption::choices). The user of GAMESMAN
 * interactive can then set the variant by selecting a value for each option
 * using the SetVariantOption method provided by the game module.
 *
 * @example A Tic-Tac-Toe game can be generalized and played on a M by N board
 * with a goal of connecting K pieces in a row. Then, we can have three game
 * variant options "dimension M", "dimension N", and "number of pieces to
 * connect (K)." A board too small can make the game less interesting, whereas a
 * board too large can render the game unsolvable. Therefore, the game developer
 * decides to allow M, N, and K to be all within the range [2, 5], and sets the
 * corresponding choices to {"2", "3", "4", "5"}, for each one of the three
 * GameVariantOptions.
