 * @brief Simple array database which stores value-remoteness pairs in a 16-bit
 * record array.
 * @details The in-memory database is an uncompressed 16-bit record array of
 * length equal to the size of the given tier. The array is block-compressed
 * using LZMA provided by the XZ Utils library wrapped in the XZRA (XZ with
 * random access) library.
