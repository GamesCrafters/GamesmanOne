Option 1: board and pieces
    a) 5 pieces each on a 16-slot board (5mm)
    b) 6 pieces each on a 16-slot board (6mm)
    c) 7 pieces each on a 17-slot board (7mm)
    d) 9 pieces each on a 24-slot board (9mm)
    e) 10 pieces each on a 24-slot board (10mm)
    f) 11 pieces each on a 24-slot board with diagonals (11mm)
    g) 12 pieces each on a 24-slot board with diagonals (Morabaraba/12mm)
    h) 12 pieces each on a 25-slot Sesotho board (Sesotho Morabaraba)

Option 2: flying rule
    a) not allowed
    b) allowed when left with <= 3 pieces
    c) allowed at all times

Option 3: Lasker rule (merge placement and moving phases)
    a) false
    b) true

Option 4: removal rule
    a) standard: pieces in a mill can only be removed when all pieces are in a
       mill
    b) strict: if all pieces are in a mill, no piece is removed
    c) lenient: anypiece may be removed

Option 5: MisÃ¨re (flip winning and losing conditions)
    a) false
    b) true

Standard combinations of options:
    (a) Five Men's Morris: [aaaaa]
    (b) Six Men's Morris: [baaaa]
    (c) Seven Men's Morris: [caaaa]
    (d) Nine Men's Morris: [dbaaa], [dbaba]
    (e) Lasker Morris: [ebbaa], [ebbba]
    (f) Eleven Men's Morris: [fbaaa]
